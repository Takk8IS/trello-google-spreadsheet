# Trello-Google Spreadsheet Integration

## Description

This project aims to create an automated solution to synchronize Trello data with Google Sheets and generate visually appealing and informative charts. The primary inspiration for the charts comes from the financial analytics platform Glassnode, and the ultimate goal is to compete with robust solutions like Power BI.

## Project Components

### 1. Trello:

-   Description: Trello is a project management tool that allows organizing tasks into cards within boards. Each card can contain a variety of information, including custom fields.
-   Use in the Project: Trello cards represent tasks, projects, or clients, and contain detailed information in custom fields such as status, dates, monetary values, among others.

### 2. Google Sheets:

-   Description: Google Sheets is an online spreadsheet tool that allows creating, editing, and sharing spreadsheets in real-time.
-   Use in the Project: Trello data is automatically synchronized with a Google Sheets spreadsheet, where it is organized and formatted for better visualization and analysis.

### 3. Charts:

-   Description: Visual graphics that help better understand the data. Chart types include bar charts, column charts, line charts, radar charts, and scatter plots.
-   Use in the Project: Charts are automatically generated in Google Sheets from synchronized Trello data, facilitating analysis and decision-making.

### 4. Power BI:

-   Description: Power BI is a business intelligence platform that enables creating interactive reports and dashboards.
-   Inspiration for the Project: The goal is to create a solution that offers similar analytical capabilities to Power BI but directly integrated with Trello and Google Sheets.
